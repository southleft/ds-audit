# Dashboard Architecture

## Overview

The Design System Audit Dashboard follows a modular, component-based architecture built with React and TypeScript. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and patterns used.

## Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between data, presentation, and business logic
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage for maintainability
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Fallback to legacy dashboard if React build unavailable
4. **Performance First** - Optimized bundle size and rendering
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation

## Data Flow

```
AuditEngine → AuditResult → DashboardServer → Express API → React App → User
```

### 1. Data Generation
- `AuditEngine` performs the audit and generates results
- Results saved to `audit/results.json`
- `DashboardServer` loads results into memory

### 2. API Layer
- Express server exposes REST endpoints
- `/api/results` - Audit results
- `/api/config` - Configuration
- `/api/chat` - AI chat interface

### 3. Frontend Consumption
- React app fetches data via `api.ts` utility
- Components receive data via props
- Local state management with React hooks

## Component Architecture

### Layout Components
- `App.tsx` - Main application shell with routing
- `Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation and score summary

### Feature Components
- `Overview.tsx` - Dashboard home with charts
- `Categories.tsx` - Detailed category analysis
- `ActionPlan.tsx` - Prioritized improvements
- `Chat.tsx` - AI assistant interface

### Visualization Components
- Chart.js integration for data visualization
- Responsive and interactive charts
- Real-time data updates

## State Management

### Local State
- Component-level state with `useState`
- Side effects with `useEffect`
- Memoization with `useMemo` for performance

### Data Flow Patterns
```tsx
App (data fetching)
  ├── Sidebar (navigation state)
  └── Content (display state)
      ├── Overview (chart data)
      ├── Categories (filter state)
      └── ActionPlan (completion state)
```

## Styling Architecture

### Design System
- CSS variables for theming
- Consistent color palette
- Typography scale
- Spacing system

### Component Styles
- Co-located CSS modules
- BEM-like naming convention
- Responsive breakpoints

## Build System

### Development
- Vite dev server with HMR
- TypeScript compilation
- React Fast Refresh

### Production
- Rollup bundling via Vite
- Tree shaking and minification
- Asset optimization

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting** - Lazy load heavy components
2. **Bundle Size** - Monitor and optimize dependencies
3. **Rendering** - React.memo for expensive components
4. **Data Loading** - Efficient API calls with caching

## Security Considerations

1. **XSS Prevention** - React's built-in protection
2. **API Security** - Input validation and sanitization
3. **Authentication** - Future: API key management
4. **HTTPS** - Enforce secure connections

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component logic with React Testing Library
- Utility functions with Jest
- API mocking for isolated tests

### Integration Tests
- Full user flows
- API integration
- Chart rendering

### E2E Tests (Future)
- Critical paths with Playwright
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility testing

## Deployment

### Build Process
1. TypeScript compilation
2. Vite production build
3. Asset optimization
4. Output to `dist/dashboard/`

### Server Integration
- Express static file serving
- SPA routing support
- API proxy configuration

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Virtualization for large datasets
- Pagination for audit results
- Progressive data loading

### Features
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Multi-tenant support
- Custom report builders
- Plugin architecture

### Technical Debt
- Migrate from Chart.js to D3.js for custom visualizations
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add comprehensive logging
- Service worker for offline support
